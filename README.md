# Gaussian Function Calculator
<br>

<h2>About this Project: </h2>

Generically, a basis set is a collection of vectors which spans a space in which a problem is solved. In quantum chemistry, the “basis set” usually refers to the
set of (nonorthogonal) one-particle functions used to build molecular orbitals. <br>
This application will help you choose among a variety of basis sets and calculate the total count of their gaussian and contracted function of any molecule of your choice.<br>
This eases out the manual effort in doing lengthy calculations and does the same within seconds. <br>

<h2>User Manual: </h2>

1.Hover over the periodic table and select the element of your choice. <br>
2.Select the basis set from the dropdown menu.<br>
3.You can do Step 1 from the dropdown menu provided in the box beneath.<br>
4.Click Calculate to get the result<br>
5.The result page will give you detailed solution to the problem.
