<h2>About this Project: </h2>
<pre>
Generically, a basis set is a collection of vectors which spans a space in which a problem is solved. In quantum chemistry, the “basis set” usually refers to the
set of (nonorthogonal) one-particle functions used to build molecular orbitals. <br>
This application will help you choose among a variety of basis sets and calculate the total count of their gaussian and contracted functions of any molecule of your choice.<br>
This eases out the manual effort in doing lengthy calculations and does the same within seconds. <br>
